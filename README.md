# Synthetic-Data-Generation-&-Augmentation-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project applies Generative AI (CTGAN) to generate synthetic patient health records and augment the Heart Disease UCI dataset. By combining real and synthetic data, machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) achieve improved recall and F1-scores in predicting heart disease.  ðŸ”¹ Key Features:  10-step EDA (univariate, bivariate, multivariate)  CTGAN-based synthetic data generation  Model training with Random Forest & XGBoost  Evaluation via ROC, F1-score, confusion matrix, and t-SNE visualization  Deliverables include report, presentation, notebooks, and trained models
